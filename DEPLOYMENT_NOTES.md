# Deployment Notes

## GitHub Actions Fixes Applied

### Issue Resolution: Build Failure
- **Problem**: GitHub Actions failing on `npm ci` during dependency installation
- **Root Cause**: Old react-scripts version (3.0.1) with Node.js 18.x compatibility issues
- **Solution Applied**: 
  - Changed Node.js version from 18.x to 16.x
  - Added `--legacy-peer-deps` flag to handle dependency conflicts
  - Added fallback from `npm ci` to `npm install` with legacy flag
  - Improved error handling in coverage checks

### Security Vulnerabilities
- **Status**: Partially addressed with `npm audit fix`
- **Remaining**: 164 vulnerabilities (mostly in react-scripts dependencies)
- **Note**: Full upgrade to react-scripts 5.x would be breaking change requiring migration

### Workflow Improvements
- Better error handling for coverage file checks
- Graceful fallback for dependency installation
- Enhanced logging for debugging

## Additional Fixes Applied (Round 2)

### Node.js Engine Compatibility Issue
- **Problem**: `lint-staged@16.1.6` requires Node 20+, but CI uses Node 18.x
- **Solution**: Downgraded `lint-staged` to `13.3.0` (Node 18 compatible)
- **Impact**: Eliminates engine compatibility warnings

### Package Lock Sync Issue  
- **Problem**: `package-lock.json` out of sync causing `npm ci` failures
- **Solution**: Updated lock file with compatible versions
- **Result**: Clean dependency installation in CI environment

### NPM Registry Authentication Issue (Round 3)
- **Problem**: E401 authentication error - CI trying to use private registry (cfa.jfrog.io)
- **Root Cause**: User's local .npmrc configured private registry with authentication
- **Solution**: Added project .npmrc to override with public registry (registry.npmjs.org)
- **Impact**: Eliminates authentication requirements in CI environment

## Current Status
✅ GitHub Actions workflow now compatible with CI environment
✅ Deployment pipeline functional  
✅ Node.js engine compatibility resolved
✅ Package lock file sync issues fixed
✅ NPM registry authentication resolved (uses public registry)
⚠️ Legacy dependencies have known vulnerabilities but are functionally stable

## Future Recommendations
1. Plan migration to react-scripts 5.x for security updates
2. Update to latest React 18 patterns
3. Modernize testing framework to latest Jest/RTL versions
